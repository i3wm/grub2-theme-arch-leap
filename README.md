# grub2-theme-arch-leap
This theme is based on [nullptrT's grub2-theme-arch-suse](https://github.com/nullptrT/grub2-theme-arch-suse) and the Grub 2 theme from openSUSE Leap 42.1. It's basically the theme from Leap 42.1 with changed background image, progressbar color and Arch Linux logo added. All changes adapted from grub2-theme-arch-suse.
